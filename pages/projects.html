          <div class="modal-text">Bell’s Beach was developed by a team of six members as the final capstone project for RMIT’s Bachelor of Design (Games) course. 
            We also worked with two external composers to produce the game’s soundtrack. 
            This game represents the best of what we have learned and developed during our time in the course, 
            especially in our production methodologies. I'm proud to say that the project is exactly what we set out to create. 
            My role was primarily that of the producer and lead programmer, but included other responsibilities such as game design, sound design, writing and cinematography.

          <div class="modal-text">Go Home, Grub was developed by a team of eight members in a Work-Integrated-Learning course hosted by RMIT and Media Molecule, 
            using the game creation tool Dreams. The game’s core goal was creating a sense of smallness, presenting common human-made objects to scale from the viewpoint of an insect, and was a massive success. 
            With a large team of unfamiliar collaborators, a set of tools we had no previous experience with, and a simulated studio environment, this course served as an incredible exercise in building production skills. 
            This was my first time working as a dedicated producer, only briefly touching Dreams directly to assist with sound design, and it was a fantastic experience. 
            This project had many points of friction and difficulty, including a novel mechanic that was ultimately cut, tension between team members, and shifting design pillars, 
            all of which I worked to mitigate, receiving commendation from my fellow team members as well as my mentors.

            <h3>Key Responsibilities and Accomplishments:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Incredibly flexible narrative game engine using a mixture of narrative scripting (Yarn Spinner) and visual scripting (Flow Canvas) to 
                create and iterate on content quickly, smoothly, and playfully with an eye for throwaway gags.
              </li>
              <li>
                The game seals itself into a password-protected zip file and refuses to let you keep playing until you say "i'm sorry" to the zip.

          <div class="modal-text">I developed Billy Teaches Friendship! on my own over a couple of weeks. 
            The narrative engine in this game really is a crown jewel for me. I've been making and remaking dialogue and narrative sequencing tools 
            as long as I've been making games, at least once a year, and it gets better every time. I'm always looking to 
            make tools that allow me, and my collaborators, to chase their fancy, add something silly and throwaway, and do so with 
            minimal friction and effort. The addition of a high-quality visual scripting toolset like Flow Canvas has been absolutely amazing, 
            and especially in the context of Unity and its steadily ballooning compile times, is a huge boon to iteration time.

          <div class="modal-text">Cosmic Commute was developed by a team of four members. 
            We sought to create a comedic adventure inspired by our shared experiences living in Melbourne, presenting a fantastical version of mundane experiences. 
            This project was my first time formally occupying the role of producer, where I hosted meetings, produced and maintained documentation, 
            and put great effort into understanding the workflows of my fellow team members to ensure the production ran smoothly. 
            The game was designed from conception to have an intensely flexible scope – a method to ensure, despite our relative inexperience working on games in a team, 
            that we could produce a polished and complete experience.

          <div class="modal-text">Monomyth is a game that I developed on my own, with an external composer who produced the title screen’s music. 
            I created this game as an exploration of visual and narrative ideas expressed through primarily level design, 
            which takes centre stage alongside very light gameplay and explicit story. 
            The idea of interpreting Joseph Campbell’s Monomyth literally was intended to poke fun at the strange and hyper specific language he used to describe it, 
            but interestingly, it also reinforced and validated the broad structure, pacing and ideas behind the concept. 
            I relied very heavily on art assets sourced from the Unity asset store among other places, 
            and used the combination of abstract imagery and shader/post-processing work to unify potentially disparate styles into one cohesive experience.

            Speedboat Alchemy was created by a rotating team of five members for the Ludum Dare 49 game jam. 
            With the theme “unstable”, we drafted the concept for the game as one that deliberately evoked a lot of stress and friction in its gameplay. 
            The player’s weapon has completely randomized properties that change every time they reload, 
            and reloading requires opening an entire menu on top of the action, manually and slowly dragging the “ingredients” into a cauldron. 
            By making these systems both heavy and unpredictable, we aimed to create an experience where the players threw their hands up and gave into the chaos, 
            frantically throwing whatever they could together.

            I created Ephemeral entirely on my own for the 1bit Jam, which had the theme of “death”. 
            I designed Ephemeral as a non-violent game that still evokes the acrobatic feeling of Hollow Knight’s combat, 
            which became the game’s central mechanic, the net, which allows you to jump additional times in the air by catching butterflies or acorns. 
            I think this was an incredible success, creating a platformer with momentary gameplay that almost feels like positioning for an attack, 
            but maintains the cute, quiet and peaceful tone. Narratively, this game was an exploration of my relationship with the idea of god. 
            What would it be like, speaking to a higher power? With this in mind, I wrote a character who truly felt benevolent, and intimate, 
            yet beyond life and understanding, and their gentle words follow you from level to level.
